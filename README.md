Drawing Application In Java

Introduction:

 In this project, the user can set the background color, draw, erase and save his drawing as an image file to the memory. The size of the brush and eraser can be adjusted. We will try to keep this drawing application just like we have the paint application on our windows computers. This drawing application in Java will have minimal yet straightforward and easy features of the windows paint application.
